# Key-Value-REPL
This is a command line REPL (read-eval-print loop) application that drives a simple in-memory key/value storage system. This system should also allow for nested transactions. A transaction can then be committed or aborted.
EXAMPLE RUN
 
$ my-program

WRITE a hello

READ a

>hello

START

WRITE a hello-again

READ a

>hello-again

START

DELETE a

READ a

> Key not found: a

COMMIT

READ a

> Key not found: a

WRITE a once-more

READ a

> once-more

ABORT

READ a

> hello

QUIT

> Exiting...
 
The commands are as follows.
 
COMMANDS
 
    READ   <key> Reads and prints, to stdout, the val associated with key. If
           the value is not present an error is printed to stderr.
    WRITE  <key> <val> Stores val in key.
    DELETE <key> Removes all key from store. Future READ commands on that key
           will return an error.
    START  Start a transaction.
    COMMIT Commit a transaction. All actions in the current transaction are
           committed to the parent transaction or the root store. If there is no
           current transaction an error is output to stderr.
    ABORT  Abort a transaction. All actions in the current transaction are discarded.
    QUIT   Exit the REPL cleanly. A message to stderr may be output.
